## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
- I think this assignment was very interesting, especially learning how to use queues to save the tokenized expression items and stacks to reorder infix expressions into postfix notation. Writing the precedence() method for the CalculateInfix class was interesting and I learned a lot about left- and right-associativity for operations.

Any questions you still have?
- Is there a more efficient way to run exception cases in a test?
